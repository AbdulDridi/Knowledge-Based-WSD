# Knowledge-Based-WSD
This is a project in which I implemented two algorithms that disambiguate words given a sentence. The two implemented algorithms are:

* Personalised Pagerank as seen in [this paper](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/COLI_a_00164 Random Walks for Knowledge-Based Word Sense Disambiguation ).
* Rudimentary wordnet similarity measures between words in a sentence.

I have also implemented and included Senseval 2 & 3 tests for both of these implementations, with detailed F1 scores generated for both.

## Dependencies
This project requires python3.x in order to run, here are some required modules:

* nltk
* numpy
* scipy
* sklearn



## Usage
##### To Be Updated Soon
